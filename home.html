      <p class="intro">For the final project in my UI/UX class, I designed a website to display my art portfolio.
        My purpose for pursing this project was inspired by the website I already have for my art portfolio;
        it is a google site that does little beyond displaying each piece and its name and medium:

      <p>
        I figured that potential users may want to know more about my art, such as whether it has won awards,
        when it was created, and how much time it took. Hence, for my development project, I created a website that
        allows you to filter amd sort my art pieces along relevant criteria, as well as included an aggregator that
        allows the user to total up how much time it took for me to complete certain pieces.
      </p>

    <div class="spacing">
      <h2 class="pbox">Visual Design Choices</h2>
      <p>I designed the website to have a modern-looking navbar at the very top that contains drop down menus for each
        filtering and sort method.
        The image of every piece is displayed on the left while a description of its attributes is on the right to help
        keep everything organized. When you add a piece to the aggregator, mini versions of the images will appear at
        the top and bottom of the screen
        for easy viewing no matter what half of the website you are on. Please have a look ðŸ¤—!
